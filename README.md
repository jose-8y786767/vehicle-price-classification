</div>

*Left: Strong positive correlation (r=0.577) between vehicle year and price. Right: Strong negative correlation (r=-0.532) between odometer reading and price*

*Left: California leads with 50K+ listings, followed by Florida and Texas. Right: Vehicles from 2010-2020 represent 68% of all listings*

### Three Key EDA Insights

**Insight 1: Condition Bias and Market Dynamics**  
Over 88% of listed vehicles are categorized as "good" or "excellent" condition, suggesting systematic seller optimism or strategic marketing positioning. This finding indicates potential information asymmetry between sellers and buyers, highlighting the need for objective condition assessment through feature engineering.

**Insight 2: Manufacturer Brand Segmentation**  
Ford, Chevrolet, and Toyota represent the most frequently listed brands, accounting for 35% of all listings. However, luxury brands like BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Audi command significant price premiums despite lower listing volumes. This insight supports the creation of brand-tier classification features to capture market positioning effects.

**Insight 3: Strong Correlation Patterns**  
Vehicle year shows strong positive correlation (r=0.577) with price, while odometer readings exhibit strong negative correlation (r=-0.532). These patterns, along with mileage-per-year ratios (r=0.67 with odometer), informed the creation of sophisticated temporal and usage-based features.

## 🔧 Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values using strategic imputation (median for numeric, mode for categorical)
- Removed outliers and unrealistic prices
- Addressed 40%+ missing values in condition, cylinders, and VIN fields

### 2. Feature Engineering (53 features created)
**Temporal Features (10):**
- `vehicle_age`, `age_squared`, `is_new`, `is_old`, `is_vintage`
- Decade grouping and era-based indicators

**Odometer Features (10):**
- Log and square root transformations
- Mileage categories, usage rates, age-interaction terms
- `low_mileage`, `high_mileage`, `very_high_mileage` indicators

**Manufacturer Features (6):**
- Brand classifications: `is_luxury`, `is_reliable`, `is_american`
- Geographic origin indicators (European, Japanese)
- Hierarchical brand tier encoding

**Additional Features:**
- Condition encoding, fuel type indicators, transmission type
- Body style categories, title status encoding

## 🏆 Key Findings

### Top Predictive Features
1. **High Mileage** (0.14 importance) - Critical threshold indicator
2. **Vehicle Age** (0.12 importance) - Primary depreciation driver
3. **Age Category** (0.10 importance) - Ordinal age encoding
4. **Very High Mileage** (0.08 importance) - Extreme usage indicator
5. **Vintage Status** (0.06 importance) - Collectible potential

### Model Performance Insights
- **Strong Performance:** Budget (78% F1) and Premium (80% F1) categories
- **Challenge:** Luxury category shows 81% precision but only 27% recall due to class imbalance
- **Generalization:** 13.9% overfitting gap, controlled through L1/L2 regularization
- **Cross-Validation Stability:** Low standard deviation (0.020) across 5-fold CV
